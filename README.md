# Pokedex

A web app to search Pokemons and see it's information, consuming the API: [pokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/).

It was designed using the Mobile First approach, with the NES.CSS in the front-end. I added a few changes to make it match the color palette I wanted.

I used HTML5, CSS3 and Vanilla Javascript.
